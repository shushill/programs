product + service 
service = 5 lakh max = A+B + project(2) = Infosys + TCS + Wipro + cognizant + accenture + HP (not necessary)
product = 10 lakh (starting)= codeforces A + B + C + D + project(2) == Amazon (WoW) + goldmann sachs + microsoft + adobe (women) + girls round + Visa + cisco
startup =  A + B + C + D + E + project(2)== Directi + Intuit + postman + CRED + inMobi


C + D = string , array, dynamic programming, graph, tree

product company = almost 5 rounds
                    1. online test = codeforces C + D ques
                    2. interview = introduction + simple question A + B
                    3. second interview = project(2) or codeforces C 
                    4. third interview = project(2) or Computer ( Operating system, DBMS, SQL)
                    5. 4th round = managerial round (behaviour test)

A + B = brute force approach 
C + D = algorithms (all company (product MNC )) 


Algorithm = brute force approach(A+B) + optimization approach (C+D) = A+B+C+D

optimization approach = iterative + recursive way  = solving method

80% of (C +D) = iterative method (easy to learn but tough to solve)
20% of (C+D) = recursion method (tough to learn but easy to solve)

optimization approcah measuring method = Time complexity + space complexity 

codeforces only cares about time complexity. 

But in Interview = Time complexity + space complexity 

codeforces = (A+B) = brute force approach 

codeforces (C + D) = optimization approach 

Interview =  50 min = 10 min talking + 1 min (question) + 10 min (thinking) + (A+B) brute force approach 10 min + (C+D) optimization approach (19 min) + verbal communication

codeforces = Div 1 + div 2 + div 3 
contest = 8 pm + 2 pm 
contest type = educational contest + normal contest 

C+D optimization = C++ Is easy for this 
                Time complexity 
                space complexity 
                maths 
                string
                array 
                dynamic programming
                graph
                tree

A+B = string , array , maths , random question, search, sort 

codeforces = 0 to 800 ratiing (A+B)
            800 to 1200 rating (C)
            1200 to 1600 rating (D)
            1600 above (E+F+G)

april to september = A+B+C + learning + daily atleast 1 question = no ability to solve a question
september to december = progress + daily atleast 2 question 

resume learning in december.

december to next year may = exam of all company for internship = next (may to july ) = product based 

next year = college company = serive based 

optimization = next learning lesson but A+B is mandatory for this.
